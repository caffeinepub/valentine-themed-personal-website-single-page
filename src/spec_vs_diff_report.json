  "summary": "REQ-20 slug validation logic was added via a new utility and is invoked in the Version 9 publish handler to block publishing when invalid. However, the diff snippet does not conclusively show that the error is rendered as a user-facing message in the UI (the render section is truncated). A few extra changes appear unrelated to the specific request (simulated publish/alert flow and meta/state summary files).",

      "requirement": "If the requested production slug is missing or invalid, block publishing and show a clear, user-facing error message in English explaining the rule and requesting a corrected slug.",
      "reason": "While validation is performed and publishing is blocked (early return), the provided EditPanel diff is truncated before the JSX that would display `slugError`. The diff summary does not definitively show the error message being rendered to the user.",
