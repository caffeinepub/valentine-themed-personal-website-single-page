  "summary": "Diff implements safer array handling in MemoriesGallery and EditPanel (normalizing to 6 slots) and improves DeploymentHealthOverlay to render failed groups/assets without crashing. However, the diff summary does not include changes to the asset smoke-check logic itself nor provides evidence that all TypeScript build errors across the frontend are resolved.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Fix all TypeScript/compile-time errors in Draft Version 7 so the frontend builds successfully (no TS errors, including React event handler type usage under automatic JSX runtime).",
      "reason": "The diff shows one likely TS fix (importing `ChangeEvent` from `react` in EditPanel), but there is no evidence in the provided diff summary that *all* TS/compile-time errors across the frontend were resolved or that the project builds successfully.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Ensure the production asset smoke-check does not produce false negatives due to pathing/missing assets; asset URLs should be root-absolute (/assets/...), and the app should load normally when required assets exist.",
      "reason": "While the overlay UI was updated to list failed groups/assets, the diff summary provides no actual code changes for the production asset smoke-check implementation (e.g., URL construction, root-absolute pathing, grouping/diagnostics), so the false-negative/pathing fixes cannot be verified from this diff.",
